RepeatFS: a file system providing reproducibility through provenance and automation

RepeatFS is a Python, FUSE-based file system with the goal of promoting scientific informatics reproducibility by recording all file and IO operations.  This provenance record can then be exported and used to replicate the original file on other systems.  During replication, RepeatFS will verify that all software versions, command line parameters, and other relevant attributes match, and will report out any deviation from the original record.  While other provenance software often involves learning scripting languages or migrating your workflow to their platform, RepeatFS operates invisibily at the file system level, and is compatible with virtually all Linux/MacOS command-line software.

In addition to replication and verification, RepeatFS also provides provenance visualization.  For any file, it is capable of generating a webpage visualizing the complete provenance history, including all programs that wrote to that file, all files read by those programs, all programs that wrote to those programs, etc.

Lastly, RepeatFS provides Virtual Dynamic Files (VDFs).  These VDFs automatically execute commonly performed tasks (such as converting file types) in a systematic and uniform fashion.  Each supported file will have a corresponding VDF presented on disk.  Upon accessing this file, RepeatFS will run the appropriate task, and populate the file on the fly with the correct information.  These files are then cached in memory, so subsequently accessing them does not require the process to run a second time.  VDFs may be chained together for combining operations, and may be copied to turn them into normal files.
